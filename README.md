# Pricehunt
ðŸ’° Checking the difference between prices of different products on [Prisguiden.no](https://prisguiden.no).

## Run in background
Use cron jobs, see [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to figure out the schedule expression for the checking interval, I recommend not more
 often than 30 minutes (this would be `*/30 * * * *`). If you have never used cron before, check out the [crontab
  command help](https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucrontab.htm).
  
```
*/30 * * * * /LOCATION/OF/PYTHON/python3 /LOCATION/OF/SCRIPT/pricehunt-py/checker.py
```
  
On Windows, cron` is not installed by default. Use the [Windows Task Scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Task_Scheduler) instead, or see this [StackOverflow
 question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/132971/what-is-the-windows-version-of-cron) for alternatives.
